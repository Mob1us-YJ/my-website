            <h3>MindRoll: Distributed Multiplayer Dice Game</h3>
            <p>Led core logic and system integration in a turn-based dice game using Python and Pygame. Designed and implemented a custom RPC protocol for real-time communication between players, ensuring robust turn synchronization and fault-tolerant reconnection. The project features a modular architecture, supports dynamic player joining, and provides a smooth multiplayer experience even under unstable network conditions. Responsible for both backend logic and user interface, focusing on user experience and system reliability.</p>

            <h3>CPU Design Using Vivado (Digital System Course Design)</h3>
            <p>Constructed a 32-bit CPU from scratch, including instruction set design, internal register management, and ALU implementation. Programmed and simulated the CPU in Verilog, then deployed it on a Xilinx FPGA board for real hardware testing. The project involved pipeline design, memory management, and debugging with Vivado tools. Emphasized modularity and scalability, allowing for future extension of instruction sets and peripherals. Demonstrated proficiency in digital logic, hardware description languages, and FPGA development workflow.</p>
